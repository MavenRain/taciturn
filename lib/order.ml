(* carried from kanon c418062 lib/order.ml, delta: this header line *)
(** The structural order and the totality certificate, M1 Stage I, brief
    3.1 and 3.2 (M1-PLAN.md:110-113).  The order is subterm only,
    syntactic and checked, never inferred:  D-M1-4
    (kanon-m0/RATIFICATIONS.md:62) excludes a sized order and a
    lexicographic order, and no part of this file infers one.

    This file is a new kernel file and not a carried one, so each
    function cites the pin line it mirrors (M1-PLAN.md:49, SI-D2).  The
    pin is kan-lang-tot-pin at 8cf0b8b and its line numbers are fixed.
    The arm mirrored here is kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/totality.ml:20-196.

    Lambda, application and match become Sec, Out and Elim respectively;
    application shapes travel beside spine arguments.  Shape access uses
    Shape.payload, Shape.point_dom and Rules.as_vpi (SA-D5).  Family
    access stays in Rules.mu_family.  Rules.at gives total indexing.
    This file counts toward TRUSTED-LINES (SI-D15). *)
