(** The NbE semantic domain, plan section 5.  Syntax uses de Bruijn
    indices, values use de Bruijn levels, and every closure keeps the
    environment it was built under.

    No shape name appears here (SA-D5, gate leg R0-AUDIT):  a former
    carries its shape as a [t Shape.t], so this file names the sum and
    never a member of it.

    The diagram of a former is a CLOSURE, not a value (SB-D23).  The two
    admitted shapes open a diagram in two different ways:  one binds a
    point, so its diagram opens by application, and the other is binder
    free, so its diagram opens by forcing.  One carrier serves both, and
    rules.ml decides which opening a shape takes, so no reader outside
    the pack has to know.

    The [Level.t option] slot of [VLan] and [VRan] is the SB-D7 carrier.
    [Eval] fills it from an [Ann] whose annotation is a universe, and
    conversion compares it through the pack, so the empty collection at
    [Univ zero] and the empty collection at [Univ one] are two values
    that never convert.  Every other shape reads its universe from the
    diagram, so the pack ignores the slot there. *)
