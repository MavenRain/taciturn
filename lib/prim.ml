(** The native primitive catalog at M0, plan section 6 and SB-D8.  Five
    primitives on the natural numbers, mirroring the closed enum of
    kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/prim.ml:20 with a much smaller row.

    [Nat] itself is a postulated constant of [Global.initial], so a
    primitive type is opaque to conversion and no rule steps into it.  The
    unary recursive presentation of [Nat] arrives at M1 with the recursive
    shape, and SPEC.md section 10 keeps the agreement lemma of the literal
    fast path against it as an obligation.

    [reduce] answers the fast path of SB-D4.  It returns [None] for a
    primitive that has no literal answer, so the caller leaves the
    application stuck instead of guessing.  [natEq] and [natLt] answer with
    a collection value rather than a literal (SB-D22), so [apply] builds
    that answer beside [reduce] and every caller reads [apply]. *)
