(** Strict positivity and the family record, brief 3.2 and 3.3, new at
    M1 Stage G (M1-PLAN.md:49).  The record carries the pin's fields
    field for field, kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/global.ml:45-70.  SG-D14:  the
    record type lives here, not in global.ml, because global.ml:132
    reads [Prim.catalog] and prim.ml:61 reads [Rules.arrow], so rules.ml
    can never name a type global.ml declares;  the table and its one
    accessor stay beside the Global table (global.ml:56-79) and
    [Global.entry] gains no constructor (SG-D1, R-Q3).  No shape name
    appears here, so R0-AUDIT stays green (dev/r0-audit.sh:6-11):  a
    former is read through [Shape.family], [Shape.point_dom] and
    [Shape.payload].  The walk is total, runs once when the constructors
    are installed (Check.define_ctors) and stores its verdict on the
    record (A4, M1-PLAN.md:95, pin check.ml:2059);  formation reads that
    verdict (rules.ml [mu_family]). *)
