(** The kernel term at M0, plan section 4.  Thirteen constructors;  two of
    them form types.  The whole sum is declared at Stage A and every
    constructor past M0 is refused by rules.ml or by check.ml with its
    milestone name (D-M0-2), so each later milestone is a loud edit to an
    exhaustive match rather than a new constructor.

    The shape of a former is written as [t Shape.t], so no shape name
    appears in this file (SA-D5).

    [motive] mirrors tot's record field for field,
    kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/term.ml:88-102.  Its one convention, stated there
    and kept here: [m_idx] is in declaration order, outermost binder
    first, and [m_body] is scoped under [m_idx] and then under [m_self],
    so de Bruijn index 0 inside [m_body] is [m_self].

    Addresses.  [APt] is the point address and carries the argument.
    [ALeg] is the leg address, used by the collection shape and by the
    pair shape.  [ACtor] is the constructor address of the two recursive
    shapes and arrives at M1 and M2. *)
