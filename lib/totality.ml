(** Totality, plan section 6 "Totality".  M1 Stage I fills the body:
    structural recursion is an elaborator translation into an
    elimination with a certificate that is checked before the
    translation, and not a driver flag.

    The certificate lives in lib/order.ml, which mirrors tot's guard
    (kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/totality.ml:188) part for part.  This file
    keeps the entry point at the signature M0 published (I-F7,
    SC-D15), so no call site changes shape:  [guard ?budget globals
    name ty body] answers [Ok (Some k)] for a body whose every
    recursive call decreases at formal position [k], [Ok None] for a
    body with no self call, and the termination error of SI-D6
    otherwise (lib/error.ml:36 and lib/error.ml:45).

    [guard_group] is the same rule over a mutual group and it answers
    the certificate itself, so the caller that translates a group hands
    that value to [Order.translate] (lib/order.ml:537) and the order is
    computed once.  [guard] is the group of one (brief 3.2, SI-D7), so
    the kernel holds one order and not two.

    The budget stays the backstop it was at M0 and its text does not
    move:  one poll per node of each body, before the certificate runs,
    so a driver cutoff fires at the same arm with the same message
    (SB-D19).

    No shape name appears in this file (SA-D5, gate leg R0-AUDIT):  the
    subterms of a former are read through [Rules.map_shape], the one
    total walk over a shape that rules.ml exports.  This file counts
    toward the TRUSTED-LINES budget. *)

(** One exhaustive traversal over the thirteen constructors of
    [Term.t], the shape of tot's [peel] and [spine] walks
    (kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/totality.ml:29 and :41) with the two of them
    fused.  It reads nothing:  it polls the budget at every node.  The
    certificate walk of lib/order.ml carries no budget of its own, so
    the cutoff of a driver is paid here, once, over the same term. *)

(** M1 Stage I, brief 3.2 and SI-D7:  the guard of a whole definition
    group.  [members] pairs each name of the group with its stamped
    body, in declaration order, and the answer is the certificate of
    lib/order.ml:459, so one caller reads the guarded position, the
    calls of every member and the constructor chain of every call from
    one value, and [Order.translate] needs no second search.

    [globals] stands in this signature for the reason it stands in
    [guard] below:  the environment tells the shape of a constructor.
    The structural rule reads the term alone
    (kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/totality.ml:97-109), so the table is not read
    here and the argument keeps every call site of M1 at one shape. *)

(** The M1 entry point (kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/totality.ml:188).  [guard
    globals name ty body] answers the guarded argument index of a
    structurally recursive definition:  [Ok (Some k)] when every call
    of [name] in [body] stands at a strictly smaller argument at the
    formal position [k], [Ok None] when [body] holds no call of [name]
    at all, and [Error (Error.Termination name)] otherwise (SI-D6).

    The direct case is the group of one, so this is [guard_group] at a
    single member and the two answers cannot drift apart.  [ty] stands
    in the signature because the declared type gives the formals that
    tot's [peel] counts;  lib/order.ml:151 peels the body instead, so
    the type is not read. *)
