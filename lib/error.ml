(** Kernel and surface errors.  Stage B extends this sum with the check
    errors;  every consumer matches it exhaustively, so a new arm is a
    compile error at every reader before it is a silent fallthrough.

    [Not_yet] carries a milestone name, plan section 5:  rules.ml returns
    it for a shape that M0 does not admit, and the parser returns it
    through [Parse] for a surface word that M0 reserves.

    [message] returns the bare text and [to_string] adds the position, so
    a test can compare the text a producer chose without also fixing the
    position format.

    Stage B adds the check arms.  Each one carries its own text, so
    [message] stays the bare producer text that a negative fixture
    compares against (SB-D10) and [to_string] adds the decoration. *)
